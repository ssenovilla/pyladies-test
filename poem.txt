seagull in the
low green sunshine
here
on this high frosted ridge
so far
from skerries, trawlings, tides

the sky is clear, the nearest
weather banked away
beyond this ridge of high

another gull comes in
on the cold tail
end of a sickle of air

there’s a game to be played
ceremonial dance
and they cut
the shape of a new moon up
from the carpet of grass
into air, pure pale blue air
where the palest curve, as
thin as a pencilled line,
new moon, is
matched by a wing
being caught
in the late sun’s glow
they are light
they are light
in the last of the sun
then they turn
